# Visualization of the Collatz Conjecture
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture for more information

## Setup
In **collatz.js** define **fullMode** in the Setup Area.
If set to **true**, all even and odd numbers in the sequence are considered for rendering.
If set to **false**, the algorithm takes a shortcut and adds a division by 2 to the odd numbers.
The result will look significantly different as the tree is now rendered with a different set of numbers.
